# Coding challenge for Zasta Web Developer Applicants

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the test environment

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The Task
There are 3 already existing customers. Imagine they are getting passed down from the App Component to a new component `Customer`. Develop this component and pass down the customers as a prop to the `Customer` Component. Please be aware to use typescript to describe how the props of the new component should look like.

Also make it possible to add new customers to the list and as a plus to edit and/or remove them.
